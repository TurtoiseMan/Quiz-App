This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Quiz Application

The application provides a quiz platform for creating, taking, and tracking quizzes with authentication and role-based access.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

### [quiz-app.talha-khan.dev](https://quiz-app.talha-khan.dev)

**Deployment Platform:** Vercel

Try it out with these credentials:

- **Admin Access:** username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **User Access:** username: `user1`, password: `user123`
- **User Access:** username: `user2`, password: `user456`

## Project Architecture

The application uses these key components:

- **Next.js App Router**: Next.js features for routing, layout management, and server/client components
- **State Management**: Using Zustand for global state management
- **Authentication**: Simple role-based authentication system with admin and user roles
- **Data Persistence**: Client-side storage with Zustand persist middleware

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
